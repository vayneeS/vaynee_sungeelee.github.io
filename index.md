## About

I'm Vaynee — a researcher turned data analyst, passionate about how humans learn, decide, and interact with intelligent systems.

My PhD in Human–AI Interaction focused on how people learn with the help of intelligent systems — blending behavioral insights, machine learning, and thoughtful experiment design. That curiosity naturally led me to data: the patterns behind how things work, and the stories we can tell with them.

Today, I work with tools like Python, SQL and Power BI to explore data, uncover insights, and support better decisions.

- Project Beta — short description and link.
- Notes & Blog — quick notes or small posts (you can add collection pages later).

If you'd like, I can wire up GitHub repo links dynamically or create dedicated project pages.
