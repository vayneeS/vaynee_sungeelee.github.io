# Prosthesis strategies with ML

Short summary

This project (my PhD project) explores machine learning strategies for prosthesis control and decision-making. It combines behavioral experiments, modeling, and applied ML to evaluate strategies that improve user interaction with assistive devices.

Key details

- Role: Lead researcher / developer
- Methods: Behavioral experiments, supervised learning, model evaluation, data analysis (Python, scikit-learn, pandas)
- Outputs: Code, data analyses, and visualizations

Repository

The full code and documentation live on GitHub:

[Prosthesis strategies with ML — GitHub repository](https://github.com/vayneeS/prosthesis-strategies-with-ml)

How to view

- Visit the GitHub repo for instructions, README, and examples.
- If you'd like, I can add a short walkthrough here (how to run experiments, reproduce figures, etc.).

## Quick excerpt from the project README

This project investigates how different machine learning training strategies can improve gesture recognition accuracy and enhance users' understanding of ML systems for prosthetic arm control. The system uses electromyographic (EMG) signals from the Myo armband to classify hand gestures and movements, enabling intuitive control of prosthetic devices.

### Highlights

- Evaluates three curriculum strategies: Random Curriculum (RC), User Choice Curriculum (UCC), and Gesture Separability Curriculum (GSC).
- Uses LDA classifier and time-domain EMG features (RMS).
- Demonstrated that the adaptive, system-driven strategy (GSC) produced the fastest and largest improvements in accuracy and better user mental models.

### Example results

Below are two representative figures from the project README (linked from the project repository):
