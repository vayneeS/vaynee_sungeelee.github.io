                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Controlling an upper-limb prosthesis means learning how muscle signals (EMG) are translated into 
                    actions by a machine-learning classifier. Training strategies directly affect how quickly and how 
                    well users acquire this control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this project, I analyzed EMG data from users performing gesture training under different strategies 
                    to answer a simple product question: <strong>how should we structure training so that people learn 
                    faster and control the device more reliably?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>This case study reframes my PhD work as an end-to-end data analysis project, showcasing how I:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Work with noisy biosignals</li>
                    <li>Define clear metrics for learning</li>
                    <li>Compare training strategies</li>
                    <li>Extract product-ready insights and recommendations</li>

                <p>
                    Reframed from the original research aims, the analysis focused on three core business questions:
                </p> 

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>2. Does adaptive training strategy improve the classifier's performance during training?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I treat trial-level classification accuracy as a proxy for quality of EMG control and skill 
                        acquisition, and compare it across strategies.
                    </p>

                    <h4>1. Can adaptive training help users reach accurate prosthesis control faster?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Here, I compare how quickly users improve classification accuracy under different training 
                        strategies. This reflects learning speed and onboarding efficiency.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I evaluate user performance on post-training functional tests to assess whether they have a 
                        more accurate intuition of how the ML model responds to their gestures.

                    These questions could translate into product concerns such as <strong>reducing time to competency, 
                    improving user experience, and increasing long-term confidence in the device</strong>.

                <h3>Methodology: From Noisy EMG to Learning Curves</h3>
                <p>
                    Even with a relatively small dataset, EMG signals are inherently noisy. I applied focused, 
                    realistic preprocessing steps:
                </p>

                <h4>RMS smoothing of EMG channels</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Applied Root Mean Square (RMS) smoothing to each channel</li>
                    <li>Reduced high-frequency noise and stabilized signal envelopes</li>
                    <li>Prepared the data for robust classification and feature extraction</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Participant-level outlier removal</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identified participants with extreme average accuracy values (e.g. >3 standard deviations from the group)</li>
                    <li>Removed these outliers to avoid distorted group-level trends</li>
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> cleaner learning curves and more reliable comparisons between strategies</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Aggregated window-level classifier predictions into a single accuracy score per trial</li>
                    <li>Enabled consistent tracking of performance for each user across 120 trials</li>

                <div class="finding-card">
                    <h4>🚀 Insight 1 – Adaptive training accelerates learning</h4>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Insight:</strong> Users trained with the adaptive strategy (GSC)improved their classification 
                        accuracy significantly faster than those in the random or teacher-led conditions. Learning curves 
                        show steeper improvement and earlier stabilization, indicating more efficient learning dynamics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Integrate performance-based adaptive curriculum into the prosthesis 
                        training workflow. Automatically selecting the next gesture based on user performance can shorten 
                        onboarding time, reduce trial-and-error frustration, and make early sessions more rewarding for 
                        new users.

                <div class="finding-card">
                    <h4>🎯 Insight 2 – Adaptive training leads to stronger gains in performance</h4>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Insight:</strong> By the end of training, the adaptive strategy (GSC) achieved both a 
                        larger increase in accuracy compared to baseline strategies. This 
                        suggests that strategic practice helps users learn faster, with similar final accuracies compared to other strategies. This could lead to more 
                        reliable control in the long run.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Make adaptive training the default path for new prosthesis users, 
                        while keeping random or fixed curricula only as backup options. This can reduce the number of 
                        sessions required to reach clinical competency and lower the support load for clinicians or 
                        product specialists.

                    <h4>🧠 Insight 3 – Adaptive training strengthens user mental models</h4>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Insight:</strong> Users trained with the adaptive strategy performed better on post-training 
                        functional tests, indicating a deeper understanding or intuition of how the prosthesis interprets their muscle 
                        signals. 
                    <p>
                        <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Strengthen the intuition by combining adaptive training with simple in-app feedback that explains 
                        why specific gestures are selected or repeated. Surfacing this logic helps users form accurate 
                        expectations of the device, improving long-term trust, adherence, and overall user satisfaction.
