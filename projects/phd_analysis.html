                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the problems faced by prosthesis users is the lack of control of their device over time. Controlling an upper-limb prosthesis means learning how muscle signals (EMG) are translated into
                        actions by a machine-learning classifier. Training strategies directly affect how quickly and how
                        well users acquire this control.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this project, I analyzed EMG data from users performing gesture training under different strategies
                        to answer a simple product question: <strong>how should we structure training so that people learn
                        faster and control the device more reliably?</strong>. The strategy I developed is adaptive, which means
                        that it tailors the training sequence based on each user's performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>This case study reframes my PhD work as an end-to-end data analysis project, showcasing how I:</p>

                    <h2>Business Questions</h2>
                    <p>
                        Reframed from the original research aims, the analysis focused on three core business questions:
                    </p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>2. Does an adaptive training strategy improve the classifier's performance during training?</h4>
                        <p>
                            I treat trial-level classification accuracy as a proxy for quality of EMG control and skill
                            acquisition, and compare it across strategies.
                        </p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>1. Can adaptive training help users reach accurate prosthesis control faster?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Here, I compare how quickly users improve classification accuracy under different training
                            strategies. This reflects learning speed and onboarding efficiency.
                        </p>

                        <h4>3. Does adaptive training strengthen the user's mental model of how the prosthesis interprets their movements?</h4>
                        <p>
                            I evaluate user performance on post-training functional tests to assess whether they have a
                            more accurate intuition of how the ML model responds to their gestures.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        These questions could translate into product concerns such as <strong>reducing time to competency,
                        improving user experience, and increasing long-term confidence in the device</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Data collection and Key Metrics</h2>
                    <p>
                        The dataset comes from EMG-based training sessions which I led, where users practiced hand and wrist gestures
                        with different training strategies. The goal was to see how these strategies affected learning and control.
                        I used a Myo armband to collect multichannel EMG data as users trained a machine-learning classifier to recognize their gestures.
                        The Myo device streams EMG signals from 8 sensors placed around the forearm, capturing muscle activity during gesture attempts.

                            Users performed a series of hand and wrist gestures while the device recorded multichannel EMG signals.
                            A robotic prosthesis provided real-time feedback based on the classifier's predictions.

                                        After the training phase, a post-test was performed to generate an independent test set, which was then used to evaluate model accuracy throughout the training process.</li>

                                LDA works well for prosthesis classification because it is fast, interpretable, and performs reliably even with noisy or limited EMG data.
                                Its strength lies in how it maximizes class separability: it finds a projection where signals from different movements are pushed as far apart as possible while each movement remains internally compact.
                                This makes LDA both efficient and robust for real-time control systems. The adaptive training strategy (GSC) specifically leverages this property by selecting gestures that are less separable, thereby focusing user practice on the most challenging distinctions.

                            The adaptive strategy displays a slower early increase and seems to reach a plateau near the end of training.
                            The differences in final accuracy across strategies are not significant, meaning that there is no evidence that they are similar.

                        <h4>🚀 Insight 1 – Adaptive training accelerates learning</h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Insight:</strong> Users trained with the adaptive strategy (GSC) improved their classification
                            accuracy significantly faster (x% increase, p < 0.05, effect-size = ) than other groups. Learning curves
                            show steeper improvement and earlier stabilization, indicating more efficient learning dynamics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Integrate performance-based adaptive curriculum into the prosthesis
                            training workflow. Automatically selecting the next gesture based on user performance can shorten
                            onboarding time, reduce trial-and-error frustration, and make early sessions more rewarding for
                            new users.

                        <h4>🎯 Insight 2 – Adaptive training leads to stronger gains in performance</h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Insight:</strong> By the end of training, users trained with the adaptive strategy (GSC) achieved both a
                            larger increase in accuracy (x% increase, p < 0.05, effect-size = ) compared to other groups. With final accuracies which converge for all strategies,
                            adaptive training appears to help users learn faster. This could lead to more reliable control in the long run.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Make adaptive training the default path for new prosthesis users,
                            while keeping random or fixed curricula only as backup options. This can reduce the number of
                            sessions required to reach clinical competency and lower the support load for clinicians or
                            product specialists.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Insight:</strong> Users trained with the adaptive strategy performed better (x% , p < 0.05, effect-size = ) on post-training
                            functional tests, indicating a deeper understanding or intuition of how the prosthesis interprets their muscle
                            signals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Strengthen the intuition by combining adaptive training with simple in-app feedback that explains
                            why specific gestures are selected or repeated. Surfacing this logic helps users form accurate
                            expectations of the device, improving long-term trust, adherence, and overall user satisfaction.

                        (RMS smoothing) and targeted outlier removal, can significantly improve how users learn to control a
                        machine-learning-driven device.
