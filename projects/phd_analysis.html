                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the problems faced by prosthesis users is the lack of control of their device over time. Controlling an upper-limb prosthesis means learning how muscle signals (EMG) are translated into
                        actions by a machine-learning classifier. Training strategies directly affect how quickly and how
                        well users acquire this control.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this project, I analyzed EMG data from users performing gesture training under different strategies
                        to answer a simple product question: <strong>how should we structure training so that people learn
                        faster and control the device more reliably?</strong>. The strategy I developed is adaptive, which means
                        that it tailors the training sequence based on each user's performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>This case study reframes my PhD work as an end-to-end data analysis project, showcasing how I:</p>

                    <p>
                        Reframed from the original research aims, the analysis focused on three core business questions:
                    </p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>2. Does an adaptive training strategy improve the classifier's performance during training?</h4>
                        <p>
                            I treat trial-level classification accuracy as a proxy for quality of EMG control and skill
                            acquisition, and compare it across strategies.
                        </p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>1. Can adaptive training help users reach accurate prosthesis control faster?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Here, I compare how quickly users improve classification accuracy under different training
                            strategies. This reflects learning speed and onboarding efficiency.
                        </p>

                        <h4>3. Does adaptive training strengthen the user's mental model of how the prosthesis interprets their movements?</h4>
                        <p>
                            I evaluate user performance on post-training functional tests to assess whether they have a
                            more accurate intuition of how the ML model responds to their gestures.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        These questions could translate into product concerns such as <strong>reducing time to competency,
                        improving user experience, and increasing long-term confidence in the device</strong>.

                    <h2>Data collection and Key Metrics</h2>
                    <p>
                        The dataset comes from EMG-based training sessions which I led, where users practiced hand and wrist gestures
                        with different training strategies. The goal was to see how these strategies affected learning and control.
                        I used a Myo armband to collect multichannel EMG data as users trained a machine-learning classifier to recognize their gestures.
                        The Myo device streams EMG signals from 8 sensors placed around the forearm, capturing muscle activity during gesture attempts.

                            Users performed a series of hand and wrist gestures while the device recorded multichannel EMG signals.
                            A robotic prosthesis provided real-time feedback based on the classifier's predictions.

                                LDA works well for prosthesis classification because it is fast, interpretable, and performs reliably even with noisy or limited EMG data.
                                Its strength lies in how it maximizes class separability: it finds a projection where signals from different movements are pushed as far apart as possible while each movement remains internally compact.
                                This makes LDA both efficient and robust for real-time control systems. The adaptive training strategy (GSC) specifically leverages this property by selecting gestures that are less separable, thereby focusing user practice on the most challenging distinctions.

                            accuracy significantly faster (x% increase, p < 0.05, effect-size = ) than other groups. Learning curves
                            show steeper improvement and earlier stabilization, indicating more efficient learning dynamics.

                            training workflow. Automatically selecting the next gesture based on user performance can shorten
                            onboarding time, reduce trial-and-error frustration, and make early sessions more rewarding for

                            <strong>Insight:</strong> By the end of training, users trained with the adaptive strategy (GSC) achieved both a
                            larger increase in accuracy (x% increase, p < 0.05, effect-size = ) compared to other groups. With final accuracies which converge for all strategies,
                            adaptive training appears to help users learn faster. This could lead to more reliable control in the long run.

        <div class="story-section" id="overview">
          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Prosthetic arm users struggle to maintain reliable control of their
            devices. Training strategies directly impact how quickly users learn
            to translate muscle signals (EMG) into accurate prosthetic
            movements—but most systems use random, one-size-fits-all approaches
            that ignore individual learning needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Question:</strong> Can an adaptive training strategy—one
            that personalizes gesture selection based on real-time performance
            help users learn faster and achieve better long-term control?
          </p>

        <!-- APPROACH -->
        <div class="story-section" id="approach">
          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>
            To test the adaptive training strategy, I did a user study comparing
            it to two other training strategies across 50+ participants:
          </p>

          <div class="data-list">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Random:</strong> Gestures presented in random order
                (baseline)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>User-Choice:</strong> Users select gestures based on
                perceived difficulty
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Adaptive:</strong> Adaptive strategy that selects
                gestures based on classifier performance, focusing practice
                where it matters most

        </div>

        <div class="story-section" id="data-pipeline">
          <h2>Data Pipeline Design</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>The Challenge:</strong> Raw EMG signals from wearable
            sensors are produced from muscle contractions, which can change 
            with sensor placement or user fatigue, confusing classification models.
          </p>
            <p>
            I designed and implemented a data pipeline to turn raw, noisy sensor signals into reliable, actionable data. 
            The first step was signal cleaning: removing electrical interference while preserving meaningful muscle activity. 
            Next, I standardized the 8 sensor channels so each one contributed equally—similar to balancing audio inputs so no single signal dominates the output. 
            Finally, I aggregated high-frequency predictions (every 200ms) into one performance score per trial, enabling consistent tracking across 120 training rounds per user.
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Without proper preprocessing, models risk learning noise instead of real movement patterns. 
            This pipeline improved data quality, ensured fair comparisons across 50+ users with different physiologies and sensor placements, 
            and made performance metrics robust enough for large-scale analysis.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 2. MACHINE LEARNING -->
        <div class="story-section" id="machine-learning">
          <h2>Machine Learning: How the System Recognizes Gestures</h2>
            <p>
            <strong>The Model:</strong> I implemented Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to classify gestures from sensor data. 
            In simple terms, LDA identifies the clearest boundaries between gesture categories by maximizing the separation 
            between them. Rather than memorizing individual samples, it learns the core signal patterns that distinguish one gesture from another.
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>Why this approach?</strong> The dataset was relatively small (120 training rounds) and the signals were inherently noisy. 
            LDA is well-suited for this context because it performs efficiently with limited data and low-dimensional inputs 
            (8 sensor features per gesture). Its simplicity reduces the risk of overfitting and keeps the model stable and interpretable.
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>The Adaptive Layer:</strong> After each training round, the system analyzes classification errors to identify 
            which gesture pairs are most frequently confused. These gestures are then prioritized in the next round. 
            Instead of random repetition, the training loop focuses on the user’s specific weak points, making the system both 
            data-driven and performance-optimized.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 3. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS -->
        <div class="story-section" id="statistical-analysis">
        <h2>Statistical Analysis: Validating Impact</h2>
        
        <p>
            <strong>The Objective:</strong> Observing different learning curves wasn’t enough. 
            We need to validate that the performance gaps between training strategies were statistically meaningful—not random variation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Learning Speed:</strong> I quantified each participant’s improvement rate over time and compared groups using ANOVA. 
            The analysis showed that users trained with the adaptive training strategy improved significantly faster than the other groups. 
            The likelihood that this difference occurred by chance was less than 0.1%, indicating a strong and reliable effect.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Skill Transfer:</strong> I also evaluated whether participants could apply what they learned to reproduce gestures which would likely be recognised with the trained classifier —an indicator of true skill acquisition rather than memorization. 
            Because the performance scores were not normally distributed, I used a non-parametric test (Kruskal-Wallis). 
            The adaptive group again outperformed the user-choice group, with only a 3% probability that this result was due to chance (p = 0.03).

            <strong>Effect Size:</strong> Beyond statistical significance, it’s important to measure 
            how large the difference actually is. Effect size quantifies the magnitude of impact— 
            for example, using metrics such as η² (eta squared) for ANOVA or Cohen’s d for pairwise 
            comparisons. 
            For clarity and readability, detailed effect size values are not reported here, 
            but they were computed during the analysis to ensure the results were not only 
            statistically significant but also practically meaningful.

        <h2>Key Results & visualizations</h2>

        <h3>1. Adaptive training reduces time-to-competency</h3>

            src="../images/Learning_rates_by_strategy.png"
            alt="Learning rates by strategy"
            class="responsive-img"
        />
        <figcaption>
            Users exposed to adaptive gesture selection improved significantly faster 
            than those using random or self-directed practice. Statistical validation 
             confirms this is a robust effect, not random variation. 
            In practical terms: the adaptive system increases learning speed.

        <h3>2. Faster learning — without sacrificing final performance</h3>
        <figure>
        <img
            src="../images/accuracy_across_trials_by_strategy.png"
            alt="Accuracy across trials"
            class="responsive-img"
        />
        <figcaption>
            All groups reached similar peak accuracy by the end of training. 
            The difference lies in speed: users trained with the adaptive strategy achieved proficiency earlier. 
            This translates into reduced training time while maintaining the same 
            performance ceiling — an efficiency gain with no trade-off in quality.

        <h3>3. Stronger skill transfer and system understanding</h3>
        <figure>
        <img
            src="../images/TPR.png"
            alt="Test accuracy"
            class="responsive-img"
        />
        <figcaption>
            When tested on new movement sequences, users trained using the adaptive strategy performed significantly 
            better (p = 0.03) than users of the user-choice strategy. This indicates deeper skill acquisition and better generalization, 
            rather than short-term memorization.

          <h2>Key Insights</h2>

          <div class="finding-card">
            <h4>🚀 Faster onboarding</h4>
            <p>
              Adaptive training reduces time-to-competency by focusing practice
              on gestures the classifier struggles with. This creates steeper
              learning curves without requiring more total practice time.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Impact:</strong> Shorter training sessions, lower user
              frustration, faster clinical deployment
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="finding-card">
            <h4>🧠 Better user understanding</h4>
            <p>
              Users trained adaptively developed stronger mental models—they
              understood why the system responded the way it did, not just how
              to trigger specific actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Impact:</strong> Improved long-term adherence, reduced
              support load, higher user confidence
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="finding-card">
            <h4>🎯 Practical implementation</h4>
            <p>
              The adaptive strategy is simple: select gestures with lowest
              classifier separability.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Impact:</strong> Easy to integrate into existing
              prosthetic training systems
            </p>

        <!-- RECOMMENDATIONS -->
        <div class="impact-statement" id="recommendations">
          <h3>Recommendations</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>For product teams:</strong> Make adaptive training the
            default onboarding path. Use random/user-choice only as fallback
            options for users who prefer more control.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 15px">
            <strong>For UX designers:</strong> Insist on the logic behind
            gesture selection—show users why they're practicing specific
            movements. This transparency builds trust and strengthens mental
            models.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 15px">
            <strong>For researchers:</strong> Test this approach beyond
            prosthetics —any human-ML system where users learn to generate
            signals (BCIs, rehabilitation tech, surgical training) could benefit
            from adaptive training.
