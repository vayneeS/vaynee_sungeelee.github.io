# IN this age of AI, one positive outcome is in education 
# personalisation 
# connecting learning to their ability
# leveraging AI to 
# moving from passive to active learning experience
# one on one teaching experience
# removes boredom/ struggling
# human involved in what to teach - expert
# benefits of personalisation - engagement (problem that they care about), prevent gap in understanding, 
# engagement is a big issue- stay motivated if you have a private tutor- adapt in so many ways-solves many problemns in online education - example gamification but does not benefit educational aspect (sacrifices learning)
# AI helps improve the educational aspect
