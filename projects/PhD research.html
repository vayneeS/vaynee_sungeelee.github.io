                <h2>The Challenge We Face</h2>
                <p>
                    Every day, millions of people work to master physical skills — stroke survivors relearning to write, 
                    athletes perfecting their technique, surgeons training for precision procedures. Yet traditional training 
                    follows a <strong>one-size-fits-all approach</strong> that ignores a fundamental truth: 
                    <em>everyone learns differently</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In rehabilitation centers, therapists struggle to adjust exercises in real-time for each patient. 
                    In EdTech platforms teaching motor skills, learners receive the same progression regardless of their 
                    individual needs. The result? <strong>Slower progress, lower motivation, and missed potential</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if we could give every learner their own adaptive coach — one that watches their every movement 
                    and adjusts training instantly?
                </p>

                <h2>Our Approach: AI Meets Motor Learning</h2>
                <p>
                    Random practice has been shown to be effective for learning motor skills, but does not consider the skill level of the learner.
                    During my PhD, I set out to answer a critical question: <strong>Can machine learning personalize 
                    motor skill training more effectively than a random practice schedule?</strong>.
                </p>
                
                <div class="methodology">
                    <h3>The Experiment</h3>
                    <p>
                        I designed a controlled study where participants learned to trace curved paths using an infrared 
                        marker — a task that mirrors real-world motor challenges in rehabilitation (regaining hand control) 
                        and professional training (surgical precision).
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                        By varying the channel width, we controlled difficulty: <em>narrow channels = harder, 
                        wide channels = easier</em>. But here's the key innovation: instead of following a fixed 
                        training sequence, an <strong>AI algorithm decided which difficulty to present next</strong>, 
                        based on each learner's real-time performance.
                    </p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>The Machine Learning Strategy</h3>
                    <p>
                        We used a <strong>multi-armed bandit algorithm</strong> — a technique that balances trying 
                        new challenges (exploration) with reinforcing what works (exploitation). The system continuously 
                        analyzed two key metrics:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Can the learner stay within the path?</li>
                        <li><strong>Movement smoothness (jerk):</strong> How expert-like are their movements?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                        Based on these signals, the AI selected the next exercise to maximize learning progress — 
                        just like an expert therapist would, but at scale.

                    Compared to traditional random practice and semi-adaptive methods, the AI-personalized training 
                    produced remarkable results:

                        <h4>🎯 Superior Movement Quality</h4>
                        <p>
                            Learners achieved <strong>smoother, more expert-like movements</strong> — the hallmark 
                            of true motor mastery. In rehabilitation, this means safer, more natural motion. In 
                            professional training, it translates to efficiency and precision.

                            This is critical: stroke patients must adapt skills to daily life, athletes face 
                            ever-changing conditions, trainees encounter scenarios beyond their practice.

                    <h3>Why Movement Smoothness Matters</h3>
                    <p>
                        While accuracy is important, <strong>smoothness is the hidden marker of expertise</strong>. 
                        Surgeons with smoother hand motions make fewer errors. Athletes with fluid movements use 
                        energy more efficiently and reduce injury risk. Rehabilitation patients with smoother motion 
                        regain functional independence faster.

                        Our AI didn't just help people complete the task — it helped them develop <em>higher-quality

                    Traditional motor learning treated everyone the same. Human experts could personalize training,

                <p>
                    By teaching machines to recognize what each learner needs, when they need it, we're not 
                    replacing human expertise — we're <em>extending it to everyone</em>.

                <h2>A Double Challenge in Rehabilitation</h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine losing a limb and being fitted with a robotic prosthesis controlled by your muscle signals. 
                    You must learn to perform gestures — open hand, close fist, rotate wrist — while simultaneously 
                    <strong>training a machine learning algorithm to recognize your intentions</strong>. It's like 
                    learning to speak a new language while teaching someone else to understand you at the same time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For thousands of prosthetic users worldwide, this is their daily reality. EMG-based prosthetic 
                    systems read electrical signals from residual muscles, but there's a critical problem: 
                    <em>beginners produce noisy, inconsistent signals</em>. The machine learning model struggles 
                    to interpret them, and users grow frustrated as their prosthesis responds unpredictably. 
                    Muscle patterns can also change over time, making it difficult to retrain the classifier if the user doesn't understand why recognition is poor
                </p>
                <p>
                    Traditional rehabilitation takes an unfocused approach — gestures are practiced in random or 
                    fixed order, with no consideration for which movements are actually difficult for the user or 
                    confusing for the algorithm. The result? <strong>Slower recovery, lower accuracy, and users 
                    who never develop intuitive control</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if we could design a training system that teaches both the human and the machine simultaneously?

                <p>
                    In this project, I tackled a fundamental question: <strong>Can we create an intelligent curriculum 
                    that adapts to both the user's motor learning needs and the classifier's training requirements?</strong>
                </p>

                    <h3>The Innovation: A Two-Way Learning System</h3>
                    <p>
                        Instead of forcing users through predetermined exercises, we designed an <strong>adaptive 
                        motor-learning framework</strong> that monitors both human performance and machine learning 
                        model accuracy in real-time.

                        The key insight: <em>the order in which gestures are practiced matters enormously</em>. Just as 
                        you wouldn't teach a child to read by starting with Shakespeare, prosthetic users shouldn't 
                        practice the most confusing gestures first.

                    <p><strong>Random Curriculum (RC):</strong> The standard approach used today — gestures presented 
                    randomly, with no strategic planning. This is our baseline.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>User Choice Curriculum (UCC):</strong> Users decide which 
                    gesture to practice next. This promotes autonomy and engagement but provides no expert guidance 
                    on optimal learning sequences.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Gesture Separability Curriculum (GSC):</strong> Our adaptive 
                    system analyzes the classifier's internal representations and intelligently selects the next gesture 
                    that will <em>maximize class separability</em> — essentially practicing the movements that are 
                    currently most confused, where improvement will have the biggest impact.</p>
                </div>

                <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
                    Think of GSC as an expert rehabilitation therapist who constantly assesses: "Which movement is this 
                    patient struggling with most? Which gesture is the prosthesis misinterpreting? Let's focus there."

                    <h3>Why This Approach Matters</h3>
                    <p>
                        Traditional prosthetic training treats the human and the machine as separate entities: first 
                        train the user, then hope the classifier adapts. But they're <strong>learning partners</strong>. 
                        When the system understands both sides of the equation — which movements challenge the user 
                        AND which patterns confuse the algorithm — it can orchestrate training that optimizes both 
                        simultaneously.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                        This isn't just about speed. Users who understand their prosthesis intuitively are more likely 
                        to wear it consistently, experience fewer frustrations, and integrate it successfully into 
                        daily activities. <em>Better training leads to better outcomes, not just better metrics.</em>

                <p>
                    This research proves that adaptive curricula can improve how we approach motor rehabilitation — 
                    creating systems that guide users through optimal learning sequences while simultaneously 
                    building robust machine learning models. It's personalized therapy at scale.

                <h2>Beyond Prosthetics: A New Paradigm</h2>
                <p>While this work focused on prosthetic control, the principles extend far beyond:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stroke rehabilitation:</strong> Adaptive exercise selection that targets motor 
                        impairments intelligently, focusing effort where it yields maximum functional recovery
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Brain-computer interfaces:</strong> Teaching users to generate clear neural signals 
                        while training decoders to interpret them — critical for assistive communication devices
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Any Human-AI collaboration:</strong> Domains where humans must learn to work 
                        effectively with intelligent systems that are simultaneously learning from them

                <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
                <p>
                    Together, these projects reveal a fundamental insight about the future of rehabilitation technology: 
                    <strong>the best learning systems don't just track progress — they actively shape it</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether personalizing motor skill training or coordinating human-machine co-learning, adaptive AI 
                    can deliver what expert therapists have always provided: <em>the right challenge, at the right time, 
                    for the right reason</em>. This is just the beginning — we need to continue to explore how to bring such expertise to millions, not just 
                    the privileged few with access to specialized rehabilitation centers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is rehabilitation reimagined — not as a one-size-fits-all protocol, but as a <strong>dynamic, 
                    intelligent partnership</strong> between human learners, adaptive algorithms, and assistive technology. 
                    A partnership that meets each person exactly where they are and guides them to where they need to be.
