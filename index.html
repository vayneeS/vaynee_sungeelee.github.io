                I have a research background in how humans learn, decide, and interact with intelligent systems. 
                Before that, I was a Salesforce consultant helping businesses optimize their CRM solutions.
                I’m now building on that foundation by upskilling in data analytics to uncover the why's behind the numbers.
                My goal is to leverage those skills to support business decision-making.
            </p>

        With 3 years of research experience, my toolkit combines solid research methodology with practical data skills.
        I use <strong>SQL</strong> for data extraction and <strong>Power BI</strong> for analysis and visualization, 
        and I have also leveraged <strong>Python</strong> for machine learning and research workflows.
    <p>
        If you're working on challenges like these — or just want to talk about data, learning, or 
        intelligent systems — I'd love to connect :) .
