## Overview

MoviesDB transforms raw IMDb data into a clean, queryable database exposed through an interactive graph exploration interface.

The pipeline runs end-to-end: raw TSV files → relational database → graph database → Streamlit UI.

**Primary objectives:**
- Data prep & ingestion: Ingest and structure the IMDb dataset into a relational MySQL database
- Write SQL queries to extract and transform subsets of interest (Marvel films)
- No-Code database: Import structured data into Neo4j to leverage graph queries for relationship exploration
- Visualization: Build a Streamlit app for interactive visualization of Marvel movie , actor and director relationships
- Testing and automation: Experiment with different frameworks to benchmark performance
- Develop CI/CD pipelines to test and deploy code after testing

## Architecture

| Stage | Tool | 
|---|---|
| Ingestion & storage | MySQL + Docker | 
| Extraction & transformation | SQL | 
| Relationship modeling | Neo4j Aura | 
| Interactive front end | Streamlit |

## Database Schema

| Table | Key columns |
|---|---|
| `titles` | `title_id`, `primary_title`, `genres`, `start_year` |
| `names` | `person_id`, `person_name` |
| `principals` | `title_id`, `person_id`, `job`, `category` |
| `ratings` | `title_id`, `average_rating`, `num_votes` |
| `characters` | `character_name`, `person_name`, `person_id` |

---

## SQL Analytics Layer

```sql
SELECT t.primaryTitle, r.averageRating
FROM titles t
JOIN ratings r ON t.tconst = r.tconst
WHERE t.genres LIKE '%Action%'
ORDER BY r.averageRating DESC;
```

The SQL layer handles complex joins, aggregations, franchise filtering, and clean CSV export for Neo4j.

## Future Improvements

- **Marvel title extraction** - scrape the Marvel wiki to build a complete title list and join with the Movies table for precise franchise filtering

- **dbt integration** - separate SQL transformation logic from infrastructure, benchmark performance
