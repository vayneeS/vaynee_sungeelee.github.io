                <strong>About me</strong>
                I'm a data analyst with roots in human-AI interaction research. My PhD was about understanding how people learn, adapt, and interact with intelligent systems. 
                I've designed experiments, worked with sensor data from prosthetic arms, to figure out how to make machine learning work for and with people. 
                Now, I'm channeling that curiosity into the world of data and insights, where I get to explore patterns, tell stories through visualizations, and help turn raw information into decisions that actually matter. 
                This research experience has given me a unique perspective on the human side of data and technology, which I bring to my work as a data analyst.
                I try to ask the question: How can we make sense of this, and what does it mean for the people using it?

        <strong>Education & previous experience</strong>
        <div> Other than my PhD in Human-Computer Interaction, I hold a Master's in Computer Science (MoSIG) from Université Grenoble Alpes, where I specialized in human-computer interaction and computer graphics. 
        My projects ranged from optimizing camera trajectories for electric air taxi flight videos to building eye-tracking prototypes that improved search relevance.
        Fun fact: I got into Computer Science because I wanted to create Pixar-style animations.</div>
        <div> Prior to my master's, I worked as a Salesforce consultant at Spoon Consulting in Mauritius, supporting digital transformation for clients like AXA and L'Oréal. 
            I worked closely with clients to understand their needs, developing custom functionality and cleaning as well as loading data into Salesforce to ensure quality and reliability.</div>
